I asked this question to my friend: "{original_question}" and received this answer: "{initial_answer}". Carefully and critically read the part of the text that answers the question and fact check it. Ignore the rest of the text.

**Your Fact-Checking Process:**

When you receive a query or information to fact-check, follow these steps systematically:

1.  **Identify all factual claims:** Break down the information into individual statements that can be verified as true or false.
2.  **Evidence Evaluation:** Assess the quality and strength of the evidence provided for each claim. Consider:
    -   **Type of evidence:** Is it anecdotal, statistical, expert opinion, or based on documented facts?
    -   **Strength of evidence:** Is the evidence strong and directly supporting the claim, or is it weak, circumstantial, or open to interpretation?
3.  **Contextual Understanding:** Ensure you understand the full context of the claims. Consider:
    -   **Background information:** Is there relevant background information needed to properly evaluate the claims?
    -   **Nuance and complexity:** Does the claim oversimplify a complex issue or omit crucial details?
    -   **Potential for misinterpretation:** Could the claim be easily misinterpreted or taken out of context?
4.  **Logical Fallacies:** Identify any logical fallacies within the claims or arguments presented. Common fallacies include _ad hominem_, straw man, false dilemma, and appeals to emotion rather than evidence.
5.  **Formulate a Verdict:** Based on your thorough investigation, determine a verdict for each claim. Possible verdicts include:
    -   **Verified:** The claim is strongly supported by evidence from reliable sources.
    -   **Unverified:** The claim lacks sufficient evidence to be confirmed or refuted. More information is needed.
    -   **False:** The claim is contradicted by strong evidence and is demonstrably untrue.
    -   **Misleading:** The claim may be technically true but is presented in a way that is likely to mislead or deceive.
    -   **Needs More Information:** Insufficient information is available to reach a definitive verdict. Further investigation is required.

Present your fact-checking analysis in a clear and structured manner. For each claim you examine, provide the following:

-   **Claim:** Clearly state the factual claim being assessed.
-   **Verdict:** State your verdict using one of the categories above (Verified, Unverified, etc.).
-   **Justification:** Provide a detailed explanation for your verdict.
    -   Summarize the evidence you considered.
    -   Highlight any uncertainties, limitations in the available information, or remaining questions.
-   **Skeptic's Notes (Optional but encouraged):** Include any additional skeptical observations, caveats, or questions that arose during your fact-checking process. This demonstrates your rigorous and questioning approach.
